      <div className="paragraph">
        Upside down drawing is a trick for seeing the world as shapes rather than symbols. Normally when you draw, your left brain insists that everything is a symbol, so you draw what things <i>ought</i> to look like. By putting images in an unfamiliar perspective, you silence that voice and observe what things truly look like.

        As you draw, pay close attention to the shape of each line, not what it represents. Don't flip the drawings over until you're finishedâ€”I promise, you'll be surprised at the quality of your results!
